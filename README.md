# thesis

There have been many Learning Management Systems (LMS) developed for providing students with course materials, guidance through a course, etc. Examples include Moodle (which is used by UNSW), WebCMS developed in CSE, OpenLearing (developed in CSE), Smart Sparrow (developed in CSE), Canvas, etc.

One issue that is not completely addressed by these systems is the ability to easily repurpose and reuse digital assets and content. Most provide a way of using course content from a previous offering of a course however this only provides a limited amount of flexibility.

This project proposed building a Meta LMS. That is a learning management system that focus on a more fine-grained view of education resources, digital assets, contents, etc. and provides the ability to select from these resources to populate an LMS.
